# Custom Context Provider

This Drupal 8/9 module acts as a service wrapper to fix the missing vocabulary term context (see https://www.drupal.org/project/ctools/issues/2712679). It enables conditional visibility groups to work with vocabulary conditions using the Vocabulary Condition sandbox project: https://github.com/md-systems/vocabulary_condition.
